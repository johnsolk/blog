Summary: Sharing PromethION sequencing data from 4 species of Fundulus killifish

We have new long-read [ONT PromethION](https://nanoporetech.com/products/promethion) genomic DNA sequencing data from 4 species of killifish! While we're working with it, generating new Illumina PE150 data for each species, and preparing a manuscript, we wanted to share this information and data in case it is useful for anyone. Since there are not many PromethION instruments out there, these data are probably some of the first of its kind being shared generated from organisms that are not [human](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB26791).

# Thank you!
This is a collaborative effort between my two advisors, Dr. Titus Brown and Dr. Andrew Whitehead. (Seriously, a grad student could not be luckier to have two great, supportive advisors and collaborative support from lab members and colleagues. I can't believe how fortunate I am.) Other contributors are [Dr. Ruta Madhusudan](http://dnatech.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/people/) and [Tony Gill](https://twitter.com/tonygill3?lang=en). Special thanks to [PoreCamp, Texas](http://porecamp.github.io/texas/), [Dr. Charlie Johnson](https://twitter.com/BioMath?lang=en) and [Dr. Richard Metz](https://twitter.com/DNA_hole?lang=en) at [Texas A&M Agrilife Research Sequencing Facility](http://www.txgen.tamu.edu/#aboutus) for Illumina NovaSeq data from [Fundulus olivaceus](http://txstate.fishesoftexas.org/fundulus%20olivaceus.htm). And [Dr. David Duvernell at Missouri University of Science & Technology](http://people.mst.edu/faculty/duvernelld/index.html) for sending us all of these fish to us, live! THANK YOU to support provided by the Moore Foundation Data-Driven-Discovery investigator award to Dr. Titus Brown.

# Questions for the community

The purpose of this blog post is mainly to share our plan and seek advice. 

**Would anyone be interested in collaborating on an [assemblathon](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/2/1/2047-217X-2-10/2656129)-like project? If so, please contact me! ([email](mailto:ljcohen@ucdavis.edu) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/monsterbashseq))**

Since this is a new type of data, we're in unchartered territory here about some things:

* What does one do with the millions of raw fast5 signal files from the PromethION? Our basecalled fastq are 70-100 GB, but the directory of raw fast5 signal files is >600 GB for each run! Wow. To our knowledge, the only software that uses these files to polish the reads is [Nanopolish](https://github.com/jts/nanopolish) by [Jared Simpson's group](https://twitter.com/jaredtsimpson?lang=en). Since the files are so large, I haven't tried using Nanopolish yet. It it a good idea to try? What is the best way to share >600 GB of millions of fast5 files with peopel who might be interested in using it?
* Data are unfiltered. Should we remove DNA CS lambda phage spike-in before posting? Remove other reads suspected as errors (>900 Mb)?
* Is sharing these fastq data useful for anyone?
* Where is the best place to share these data? Even though [zenodo has recently upgraded their file size limits to 50 GB](http://help.zenodo.org/), it is not a good place to store these data based on their response to my request:

**Any other advice, questions, or comments?**

# New PromethION instrument at the UC Davis Genome Center
In [May 2018](https://twitter.com/meganamsu/status/997216050247864322), the [UC Davis Genome Center](http://dnatech.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/) received its PromethION from Oxford Nanopore! This was part of a collaborative effort to acquire this instrument through the [PromethION early release program (PEAP)](https://www.genomeweb.com/sequencing-technology/early-access-oxford-nanopore-promethion-requires-75k-deposit-24k-access-fee#.W70sSpNKhTY) back in early 2016 by Genome Center faculty: Dr. Richard Michelmore, Dr. Megan Dennis (who is on my dissertation committee!), and Dr. Titus Brown.

[I have been working with the ONT MinION](https://twitter.com/monsterbashseq/status/963592729241382912) to see if it is feasible to use for genome assemblies of eukaryotic organisms. Turns out that it is not. [Porecamp was very helpful for answering questions](https://twitter.com/monsterbashseq/status/959153636445073408) The PromethION has been great for our purposes. [MinION Costs](). Eukaryotic genomes are large. To achieve 30-50x coverage for a genome assembly of a 1-1.1 Gb killifish genome, we would need to use 30-50 MinION flowcells. At a [cost of $800-900/flowcell](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yBncz75kgwExCXy7sC9LsMaDGs8OJJJGg9f4o3DcoQE/edit?usp=sharing), that is not a reasonably affordable genome ($24,000-45,000). Whereas it took [39 flowcells to get ~30x (90Gb) coverage of the human genome](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/20/128835), the PromethION has sequenced [~80x coverage of human genome](https://gigabaseorgigabyte.wordpress.com/2018/05/24/promethion-human-genome-na19240/). PromethION promises [higher yield](https://nanoporetech.com/about-us/news/promethion-wild-high-yield-data-announcements-human-and-plant-dna) than MinION, allowing it to be more feasible for larger genomes >1 Gb. The cost of one [PromethION run at UC Davis](http://dnatech.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/nanopore-sequencing-ont-promethion/) is $2,880.

The avalance of data commences!

# Four species of *Fundulus* killifish

<img style="float: right;" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81SpSNXaFfL.jpg" height="200">

These species of killifish have never been sequenced before. We have a genome for the [classic physiological model](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2128618/) species, [*Fundulus heteroclitus*](http://uswest.ensembl.org/Fundulus_heteroclitus/Info/Index). But we do not have any genomic information from other important freshwater species of *Fundulus*. 

The *Fundulus heteroclitus* killifish is well-known for its extreme [resilience](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/gcb.14386?author_access_token=36pNDS0SUqB6m5gUMREijota6bR2k8jH0KrdpFOxC66a2-XVORYljQz2FrLUSYMKsfdfVt3Mxuv_BJEgeCfbetZEseZqrz14rbQRWL4-Ge1jjHI83VoyEXRrMQWXA1A3) and tolerant [model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1744117X0700072X), capable of [rapid adaptation](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/354/6317/1305), long studied for physiological resilience to salinity change.

# DNA extractions

Live samples were gratiously shipped to UC Davis by [Dr. David Duvernell](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=QQIh3CsAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). Fish heads were used for high molecular weight (hmw) DNA extractions.

* Dr. Ruta found that adding urea to lysis buffer helped [Wasko et al. 2003](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14641478)
* DNA was difficult to get into solution. (show pic)
* With the MinION, our sample was not utilizing the pores as efficiently as it could be. Only getting ~1 Gb out of a single flowcell. Others have gotten ~10 Gb. Something weird with our samples. ONT has mentioned that this is a fish-specific sample issue. Has anyone else found this to be the case with fish hmw DNA? Also brittle and breaking easily.

```

# Our plan from here:

### 1. Post data to a public nucleic acid repository

* [European Nucleotide Archive (ENA)-EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/submit/sequence-submission) 
* SRA-NCBI

What to do with the raw fast5 signal files?

### 2. Data note

# Example rough workflow:

Install miniconda Python package manager:
```
wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b
echo export PATH="$HOME/miniconda3/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Create a conda environment for software installation:
```
conda create -n ONT python=3
source activate ONT
conda config --add channels defaults
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --add channels bioconda
```

Install [minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2) (minimap2-2.12), [miniasm](https://github.com/lh3/miniasm) and other tools:
```
conda install assembly-stats minimap2 miniasm bwa samtools busco pilon mashmap
```

Assemble:
```
# Overlap
minimap2 -x ava-ont -t8 A_xenica_combined.fastq | gzip -1 > A_xenica_reads.paf.gz
# Layout
miniasm -f A_xenica_combined.fastq A_xenica_reads.paf.gz > reads.gfa
```

Use pilon to improve consensus:
```
bwa index <genome.fasta>
bwa mem -t 4 genome.fasta R1.fq R2.fq | samtools view -Sb - | samtools sort - -o ecto_old_paired_qc.sorted.bam
samtools index ecto_old_paired_qc.sorted.bam
pilon --genome F_olivaceus.canu.ONT.unitigs.fasta --bam F_olivaceus_ONT_polished.sorted.bam --threads 8
```

BUSCO for evaluation:
```
run_BUSCO.py -i F_nottii_miniasm_ONT.fa -l ${BUSCO_LINEAGE}/eukaryota_odb9 -o F_nottii_miniasm --mode genome -c 8
```

Visualize, run [mashmap](https://github.com/marbl/MashMap):
```
mashmap \
-r /mnt/home/ljcohen/reference/GCF_000826765.1_Fundulus_heteroclitus-3.0.2_genomic.fna \
-q ../../masurca_Folivaceus/CA.mr.41.15.15.0.02/final.genome.scf.fasta
```

Plot:
```
generateDotPlot png large mashmap.out
```
Edit the `out.gp` file, because of reasons.
```
vi out.gp
```
* Delete word 'tiny' in first line
* Comment out 3 lines with word 'mouse' in them.
Then run:
```
gnuplot out.gp
```
which will then produce the png file.
