I'm poking around this week, researching grad schools specifically in
Bioinformatics. There are not many schools who offer a PhD degree
specifically in this field. Computational, systems biology, genetics,
molecular biology - many schools have programs and offer specializations
in the area of bioinformatics. Schools with Core Genomics Facilities
have faculty who specialize in bioinformatics because there is a need.
I'm interested in exploring any options that might be available. This
reminds me of the [discussion of differences between fields of
bioinformatics and computational
biology](http://rbaltman.wordpress.com/2009/02/18/bioinformatics-computational-biology-same-no/).

In my searching, I came across this YouTube video from Nature Videos
about the ENCODE project at EMBL-EBI. I enjoy how it depicts scientists
studying genome sequences and intraspecies variation, looking at
variable pieces of genes being sent through tubes.

Other videos from Nature are good too. I like seeing animations of these
molecular-scale processes that I would otherwise just have to visualize
in my head.
