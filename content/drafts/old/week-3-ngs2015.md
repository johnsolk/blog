[Week 3](http://angus.readthedocs.org/en/2015/week3.html) of NGS 2015
comes to a close. Discussion onÂ what attendees and instructors have
gained from this week: most important things learned, theory/big
picture. Teaching and pedagogy especially. We went through 10 different
workflows in 1 week! Analyzed complex data sets. This is a very new
field. These methods are in development. Instructors are at the top of
their fields, sharing methods for data analysis. Always something new to
learn. Impossible to be expert in everything. But, surrounding ourselves
with a community of people who are experts, learning from everyone.
Reproducibility, automating workflows that lead to figure generation are
important.

Cool teaching tools learned:
