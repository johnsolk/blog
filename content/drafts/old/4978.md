We've been working on a manuscript with methods and results from
re-assembling the MMETSP dataset. Almost finished! On version 7 of edits
from co-authors Titus Brown and Harriet Alexander. Titus has been very
interested in the outliers in these plots, the cluster of dots circled
below. "What happened..."? This one question has been plaguing me and
has taken the past &gt;2 weeks to mostly sort it out. I've been able to
improve the assemblies (see figure at the end of this post). Frustrating
to have to re-do a bunch of work, but hey, that's part of the science
journey!

I'm super grateful for evaluation metrics we've collected to be able to
tell how the assembly did! Thanks to HyperLogLog() in khmer, created by
Luiz Irber, I'm able to digest assemblies into *k-*mers (*k=*25) and
estimate cardinality, which outputs a value of the number of
unique *k*-mers. I did this for both the NCGR and our DIB assemblies. As
you can see below, for the uniqueness of the kmers.  In the interest of
getting to the bottom of why some assemblies were not
