[Dr. Richard Lenski, Michigan State

Fascinating long-term research experiment, has been culturing E. coli
over several decades

Historical context of evolution experiments: Darwin thought evolution
too slow to observe, "no wonder evolutionary biologists are interested
in time travel"...fossils, comparative methods - looking at unique
morphology strategies used to occupy niches...

Others who watch evolution? Peter and Rosemary Grant in Galapagos
islands, looking at changes in response to environmental changes,
Herculean efforts.

**Motivating question: How repeatable is evolution?**

Core tension between chance and necessity, between mutation and natural
selection.  
Convergent evolution, similar environmental pressures, organisms as
diverse as mollucs and people with eyes have light-sensitive organs
(adaptive convergent evolution)

Want to study what directional pressure natural selection can produce,
and have repeatability!

1:100 transfer in liquid medium with limiting glucose, citrate also for
chelating agent for iron (E. coli cannot grow on citrate),
logbase2(100)=6.6cell generations per day  
started in 1988 Feb, now 63,000+ generations

Size of populations, size of genomics, every lineage has had billions of
mutations, majority are lost during dilution - random genetic drift,
deleterious also - frozen fossil record, each population frozen - can
bring out of freezer and directly compare - then repeat!

Rapid generations allow us to watch evolution proceed.

When something interesting happens, then go back and repeat

Directly measure competitive performance of one line relative to
ancestor

fitness = ratio of growth of one / growth of the other

Cannot do this with humans. Suggests, "wouldn't it be cool to compete
neaderthals against humans?"

Adapting to environment, climbing in fitness in similar trajectories

Strikingly similar in improvement

Measuring fitness in environment, different environments from where they
evolved

Tech improvement, reduction in cost made it possible to start sequencing
ancestral strain, 2k, 5K, 10K, 15K, 20K

20K clone has 29 point mutations, 15 indels, 1 inversion

45 total mutations out of genome has \~4,000 protein-coding, == 1% of
genes have mutation

Yet, many of these 45 genes have mutations in some for all of the other
11 populations, rarely the exact same mutation

Parallel or convergent evolution implies selection favored those
mutations, isogenic constructs identical

What are same tumors in different patients?

What mutations are in common between different species?

Experiment has yielded a lot of [parallel
evolution](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3245322/). Until
a striking exception. One of 12 populations was growing on citrate. But,
know E. coli cannot transport citrate into cell under oxic conditions

An extremely rare mutation? or historical contingency dependent on
particular evolutionary parth? maybe this could be rare mutation?

tested over40 trillion cells  
[zero gave Cit+ mutation!!!!!!!! Did not get
mad!](http://www.pnas.org/content/105/23/7899.short)

clones from generation onwards produced 19 additional Cit\_ mutatnts

citrate positive population has mutation in DNA repair

actualization step was a [tandem
duplication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22992527) of citT that
encodes anaerobic citrate transporter. only works under anaerobic
conditions,

regulatory elements upstream, might work under original, second copy
might have regulatory elements might be upstream of second copy - cell
has been required by putting different regulatory element next o the
second citT copy, generating a new module and function

evolution doesn't built whole new things, tinkering existing parts

generating new module and physiological capacity

"mount glucose" 3D graph of ancestor living in trough, climbing up to
glucose, citrate is in distance - need to get there

New species?

cladogenesis: divergence, followed by stable coexistence of Cit+ and
Cit- lineages

discrete novelty: citrate usage new function, not merely quantitative
change  
meangingful novelty: citrate usage contradict historical definition of
well-studied species

too loose definition, everything that has antibiotic resistance would be
new species then if that were to be true

concept: Ernst Mayr - what are species groups, reproductively isolated
from other such groups

However, bacteria are asexual and there's no horizontal gene transfer in
the long-term experiment

if hybrids are ecologically inferior, neither fish nor fowl- that would
imply a maladaptive valley between the Cit+ and Cit- lineages

And that would present a barrier to gene flow

Are they getting better, competing later generations against earliest
Cit+ and in fact they are getting better and better

Experimental evolution studies are fun!

Lab management is important. :)

Q: Differences in point mutations or indels?

A: lot of parallelism, mixed: different synonymous some cases of deleted
operon in 12/12, one end point is different in every case, some
insertions, move around and make second copy,

Question: hybrids?

A: at least a couple of genes are responsible, hitchhikers - responsible
for loss

Q: nature of species in bacteria, arising often? missing diversity
surrounding? problem to study with millions of species, operational
definition - happening constantly and rarely see it

So grateful to be present for Dr. Lenski's evolutionary discussion and
analysis of this very cool experiment, fascinating research program.
