Since finishing up all 678 MMETSP re-assemblies in the fall, I've been
focused on annotations and fixing issues we've identified by evaluating
qualities. We wanted to do a "data dump" to make the bulk of the useful
product available for people. So, turns out finalizing and annotating
678 assemblies is not trivial.

1.  Dammit is
    great:Â https://github.com/dib-lab/eel-pond/blob/annotating/5-annotating.rst
    But has issues on hpc, specifically last on intel11 needs intel14
    and intel16
2.  3.
