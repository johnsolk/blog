My tweet for this week's

science communication assignment is about a new technique by researchers
at King's College London, published in [Nature
Protocols](http://www.nature.com/nprot/journal/v11/n3/full/nprot.2016.029.html),
using freshwater gill tissue in culture as a proxy for *in vivo* fish
gill tissue which is commonly used in toxicity testing to assess whether
compounds have negative biological effects. Since gill tissue is
designed to filter water and extract oxygen and osmolytes for the fish,
it is a great method for measuring toxicity of compounds in water since
they get trapped in the gill tissue. In this fish gill cell culture
system by Schnell et al. (2016), whole fish do not have to be sacrificed
for this purpose. Instead, only the gill tissue is used to
assess potential toxicity, bioaccumulation, or environmental monitoring.
Not only is this system resource-efficient and portable, only requiring
a thin layer of tissue and some reagents to maintain, but it does not
require raising and maintaining whole animals. The elegant features of
gill tissue can be used without waste.

This video demonstrates the technique:
