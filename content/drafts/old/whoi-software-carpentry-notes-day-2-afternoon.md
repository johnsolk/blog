Theory: Typical programmer, regardless of language, will write the same
number of lines of code in their lifetime compared to any other
programmer.

Tab completion in the command line rocks. Worth the whole trip.

Calculate GC content.

    seq='ACGTACGTAGCTAGTAGCTACGTAGCTACGTA'
    g=seq.count('G')
    c=seq.count('C')
    a=seq.count('A')
    t=seq.count('T')
    gc=((g+c)/(a+t+g+c)*100)
    print('GC count is:',gc,'%')

Make functions:

    def gc_content(seq):
        seq=seq.upper()
        g=seq.count('G')
        c=seq.count('C')
        a=seq.count('A')
        t=seq.count('T')
        gc=((g+c)/(a+t+g+c)*100)
        return(gc)

Not good practice to do:

    from math import *

This is because you may be importing functions you're not aware of. If
you accidentally name one of your functions the same name, you will have
a conflict. Your namespace is polluted.

THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. THIS WILL ALLOW YOU TO IMPORT YOUR FUNCTIONS.
Keep all functions in one working directory. Set pythonpath to working
directory so it can find your functions.  
In the terminal:

    flcellogrl@flcellogrl:~/good_science$ export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)
    flcellogrl@flcellogrl:~/good_science$ echo $PYTHONPATH
    /home/flcellogrl/good_science

Runable script.  
In Python:

    def gc_content(seq):
        seq=seq.upper()
        g=seq.count('G')
        c=seq.count('C')
        a=seq.count('A')
        t=seq.count('T')
        gc=((g+c)/(a+t+g+c)*100)
        return(gc)

    def hello():
        print('Hello world.')

    if __name__=='__main__':
        print("Unimplemented")

Save in working directory.  
In Linux shell:

    flcellogrl@flcellogrl:~/good_science$ python cgc.py
    Unimplemented

Read shell on Linux shell command line.  
In Python:

    def gc_content(seq):
        seq=seq.upper()
        g=seq.count('G')
        c=seq.count('C')
        a=seq.count('A')
        t=seq.count('T')
        gc=((g+c)/(a+t+g+c)*100)
        return(gc)

    def hello():
        print('Hello world.')

    import sys
    if __name__=='__main__':
        print(sys.argv[1])

In Linux command line:

    flcellogrl@flcellogrl:~/good_science$ python cgc.py "Hello dolly"
    Hello dolly
    flcellogrl@flcellogrl:~/good_science$

Something useful:

    def gc_content(seq):
        seq=seq.upper()
        g=float(seq.count('G'))
        c=float(seq.count('C'))
        a=float(seq.count('A'))
        t=float(seq.count('T'))
        gc=(g+c)/(a+t+g+c)*100
        return(gc)

    import sys
    if __name__=='__main__':
        print(sys.argv[1])
        print(gc_content(sys.argv[1]))

In Linux shell:

    flcellogrl@flcellogrl:~/good_science$ python cgc.py ATGCGC
    ATGCGC
    66.6666666667
    flcellogrl@flcellogrl:~/good_science$

For comparable data types to data.frame in R, look more at [Python
pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) and [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/).

Things to consider for code, what to return when:

-   Mixed case: handled with string.upper()
-   Empty string: Return informative error?
-   No GC content:
-   No AT content
-   A letter of "n" or "N", meaning wildcard, flexible - could be
    A,T,C,or G: Return informative error
-   Protein sequence: Informative error.
-   non-DNA string: Informative error.
-   non-string argument: Informative error message
-   unprintable characters

    --------------------- Some things to do different next time in Woods Hole ---------------------
    - bigger room at another lab
    - or less people at NEFSC conf rm (also turn down thermostat!!)
    - knapkins
    - a better wireless and/or drop line arrangement
    - less coffee&pastry, more juice& fruit
    - end lectures earlier in the afternoon
    REMINDER:  Woods Hole Python Users Group meets every Tuesday a 11am in the Bigelow Bldg first floor conference room for about an hour to chat about Python and a few other related tools. All are welcome. Contact: james.manning@noaa.gov

    DAY 2:

    First lesson 
    http://wltrimbl.github.io/2013-11-14-woodshole/lessons/thw-git/local.html
    Basic motivation for version control:  http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1531

    WRITING PYTHON FUNCTIONS
    2013-11-14-woodshole\lessons\thw-python\functions-modules
    You do not want 
    NONONO   2013-11-14-woodshole\lessons\thw-python\functions-and-modules NONONO
    Will you share your data?
    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2zK3sAtr-4
    take your calculate_gc  funciton definition 
    and save it as calculate_gc.py     in   ~/good_science
    Navigate to ~/good_science in your shell
    cd ~/good_science
    Fire up
    python
    Inside of python   (after the >>>)
    from calculate_gc   import calculate_gc 
    calculate_gc("AGCTAGGAA")
    Q:  how can I add my own libraries / modules to somewhere where python will find them?
    A:  export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/modules
    echo $PATH
    mv calculate_gc.py dnautils.py    # renames calculate_gc.py
    python 
    import dnautils
    dir(dnautils)
    dnautils.calculate_gc("ATTTA")
    import dnautils
    dnautils.hello()
    create a file called cgc.py
    containing
    def calculate_gc(x): 
    ...
    and the two lines:
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        print "Unimplemented"
    And run it using:
    python cgc.py
    import sys
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        print sys.argv[1]
    python cgc.py  "Hello dolly"
    TESTING
    cp ~/2013-11-14-woodshole/lessons/thw-testing-gc/test_calculate_gc.py ~/good_science
    This copies  the file test_calculate_gc.py   to  good_science.
    Change from calculate_gc to from cgc   (or the name of your calculate_gc file)
    nosetests
    This is the post-bootcamp survey. Please, take the time to go through the survey we promise it's easier than the past two days have been.
