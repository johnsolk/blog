A blog that I read ([Molecular
Ecologist](http://www.molecularecologist.com/2013/11/what-were-reading-mating-advantages-for-rare-males-in-guppies-a-new-species-of-dolphin-in-australian-waters-and-dna-sequencers-on-mars/))
has a Friday post almost every week about what they're reading. I enjoy
hearing about what other people are reading. It gives me ideas. These
are some of the things I've been reading this week:

[Comparing software packages for accuracy and
efficiency](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/news/press-releases/RGASP-2013)

[Fusion primer method](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/11/109)

[NGS Target Enrichment
methods](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3605921/)

[Sequence Identification
Tags](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0042543)

[Present for

(who reads this blog?)

My town held local elections. The woman whose sign has been on my lawn
for the past month (Margot Dorfman)
[won](http://www.floridatoday.com/article/20131105/NEWS01/311050052/In-Melbourne-Beach-Simmons-wins-mayor-race?nclick_check=1)!
Jim Simmons seems like he will be a good mayor. In talking with him
about housing developments and septic tank issues on our barrier island,
he seemed to be knowledgeable and very aware of the logistics and the
situation we're in. I have an optimistic outlook for this new Commission
and Mayoral administration.

There is a [glum](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/glum) atmosphere at
work as an unpopular interim Executive Director was named from the
existing faculty ranks.

Exploring
[analyses](http://discover.nci.nih.gov/microarrayAnalysis/Distribution.Signals.jsp)
and
[different](http://www.people.vcu.edu/~mreimers/OGMDA/normalize.expression.html)
[normalization](http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/32/8/2323.full)

[microarray](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/469) intensities
for a potentially sketchy set of data.

Starting an 8-week, "[Bioinformatics Algorithms: Part
1](https://www.coursera.org/course/bioinformatics)" course.  I think
[Dr. Pavel Pevzner](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~ppevzner/) (one of the
instructors/creators of the course) is cool and has some good ideas for
teaching bioinformatics. [Biology Education needs
re-examining](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/325/5940/541.short).

Plus, he's funny and very charming:

    According to [airhead.cnt.org](http://airhead.cnt.org/Calculator/),
    I contributed 2395 lbs. of personal emissions in Oct (stupid driving

I was accepted to the [2014 Workshop on
Genomics](https://evomics.org/workshops/workshop-on-genomics/2014-workshop-on-genomics-cesky-krumlov/)

proposal writing. Some references I used:
