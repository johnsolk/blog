[This past weekend, all of us in Titus Brown's Data Intensive Biology
(DIB) lab went to]{style="font-weight:400;"}[[Yosemite
Bug]{style="font-weight:400;"}](http://www.yosemitebug.com/)[, which is
just outside]{style="font-weight:400;"}[[Yosemite National
Park]{style="font-weight:400;"}](https://www.nps.gov/yose/index.htm)[,
for our first (annual?) lab retreat. We had a great time! I personally
found it inspiring to gather thoughts on the direction of research in
the lab, ask questions about what everyone else is working on, and think
about how my research goals fit into the larger picture of the
lab.]{style="font-weight:400;"}

[Here are some notes from the weekend in case anyone is interested.
Please comment and ask questions. Further discussion is
welcome!]{style="font-weight:400;"}

**Retreat**

[In October, about 4 months prior, we all agreed on location, date and
began planning (gathering info, booked rooms and conference space from
the resort). About one week prior, we had a brainstorming meeting about
the schedule and what we would discuss.]{style="font-weight:400;"}

[Everyone drove up (\~3.5 hrs from Davis) to Yosemite Bug on Friday. We
discussed lab business on Sat and Sunday with some time in the middle to
enjoy the outdoors and discuss with each other in an informal setting.
The idea was to stimulate discussions about the lab (e.g. research,
culture and career development) in a context outside the lab. We wanted
it to be different than a conference. A retreat would just be our group,
more broad/casual than regular lab meetings, to discuss the big picture
of the lab’s research direction.]{style="font-weight:400;"}

**Saturday morning, presentations**

[To open, Titus identified major themes in the lab right
now:]{style="font-weight:400;"}  
[\* Expect many big samples continuously
arriving,]{style="font-weight:400;"}  
[\* Sketch data structures and online/streaming algorithms are
good,]{style="font-weight:400;"}  
[\* Pre-filtering is good, especially when each step has low false
negative rate]{style="font-weight:400;"}  
[\* Decentralized is good]{style="font-weight:400;"}

[Throughout the morning, there were presentations from the major
projects in the lab. Presentations were 10 min each with 5 min
discussions. Some hot topics bled over to be \~30 min each. These were
informal talks with markers and flip chart only (no slides or projector
allowed). The internet in the resort was patchy, so luckily the goal of
the retreat was not to work on anything requiring an internet
connection.]{style="font-weight:400;"}

[People gave a broad outline of what they are doing, followed by one or
two things we’re excited about (enables X and Y, or Z is an
opportunity), then 5 minutes of questions.]{style="font-weight:400;"}

[\* [Camille Scott](http://www.camillescott.org/) / Streaming the
RNAseq]{style="font-weight:400;"}  
[\* [Luiz Irber](http://www.luizirber.org/) / Architecture of all the
buzzwords (amazing basic-level explanation of the internet for those of
us who are unfamiliar)]{style="font-weight:400;"}  
[\* Taylor Reiter / sourmash RNAseq]{style="font-weight:400;"}  
[\* [Daniel Standage](https://standage.github.io/) /

**Sat afternoon, free time!**

[Weather was great, sunny! We had anticipated not-so-great weather with
just-above-freezing rain. But, this was not the case. In the afternoon,
we all piled into cars for exploration of Yosemite National Park!
Shannon Joslin did an amazing job of summarizing available social
activities into this list:]{style="font-weight:400;"}

**Sat evening, social time!**

[[Jessica
Mizzi]{style="font-weight:400;"}](http://jessicamizzi.github.io/)[, who
takes fun VERY seriously, coordinated games and
activities:]{style="font-weight:400;"}

[I participated in a few heated games
of]{style="font-weight:400;"}[[Settlers of
Catan]{style="font-weight:400;"}](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catan)[
and Pictionary. It turns out there are several members of our lab who
are relentless resource emperors and that there are varying degrees of
artistic abilities. :)]{style="font-weight:400;"}

**Sunday morning**

[Two postdoc lab members recently attended
the]{style="font-weight:400;"}[[Moore DDD early career
workshop]{style="font-weight:400;"}](https://github.com/DDD-Moore/early-career-hawaii)[
and brought back suggestions for continued discussion on the field of
‘data science’. We found it useful to discuss the larger context of how
we market ourselves, develop our careers, and fit ourselves into
biological research. Data-intensive biology is a large field. In our lab
alone, we represent diverse disciplines, e.g. Software Engineering,
Genomics, Biological Oceanography, Comparative Physiology, Medicine,
Mathematics, just to name a few. We cannot each have a deep
understanding of all of these peripherally-related topics. Yet, our
collective knowledge is great. How can we better extract overlapping
skills from each other to solve hard
problems?]{style="font-weight:400;"}

[We broke out into 3 groups of 6 people at a mixture of career levels,
e.g. beginning grad student, mid-level grad students, postdocs, post-PhD
industry-bound to address these specific
questions:]{style="font-weight:400;"}

[\* How does
Person]{style="font-weight:400;"}*[x]{style="font-weight:400;"}*[
learn]{style="font-weight:400;"}*[y]{style="font-weight:400;"}*[
topic?]{style="font-weight:400;"}  
[\* What works?]{style="font-weight:400;"}  
[\* How do we teach Davis community
about]{style="font-weight:400;"}*[y]{style="font-weight:400;"}*[ topics?
(Especially if when we might not necessarily know these things
ourselves.)]{style="font-weight:400;"}

**Discussion points**

*[The following is an approach I’m trying based on
some]{style="font-weight:400;"}*[*[helpful blogging
advice]{style="font-weight:400;"}*](https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/823183090554126336)*[:
choosing words and phrases explaining what has worked for us (or me,
specifically) rather than telling people who read this what they should
be doing. This is because I am more apt to listen to someone else’s
wisdom gained from their own experiences.]{style="font-weight:400;"}*

[- Learning topics has depended on why we want to
learn.]{style="font-weight:400;"}

[- Up to the learner for finding motivation, not necessarily a list of
what others think you need to know. Although, we acknowledged that it is
hard to figure out what you need to know, if you don’t know. Some base
level knowledge is required.]{style="font-weight:400;"}

[- We have been told that skills in bioinformatics are required for
successful future careers. However, there is no institutional-level
plans for how to disseminate these skills to
learners.]{style="font-weight:400;"}

[- Beginning learners can feel overwhelmed because of the
interdisciplinary nature of bioinformatics, sometimes requiring a
combination of knowledge and skills in computer programming, statistics,
cell and molecular biology, etc.]{style="font-weight:400;"}

[- It has helped many of us to take a project-based learning
approach.]{style="font-weight:400;"}

[- Three motivating scenarios were identified for developing a working
knowledge of bioinformatics skills:]{style="font-weight:400;"}

1.  [Biologist generating data, e.g. RNAseq for differential expression.
    In the long-term it doesn't seem to make sense to rely on a
    sequencing facility to analyze data because decisions made during
    analysis affect the results. Making these decisions requires
    revisiting the question of why the data were generated in the first
    place, which is not necessarily within the scope of an independently
    contracted analyst to be familiar with. It has been our experience
    that data are best analyzed by people who know the projects very
    well.]{style="font-weight:400;"}
2.  [Data analyst understanding many projects simultaneously and
    advising those generating and analyzing their own data what is the
    best way to approach analysis based on their own experiences,
    consensus in the field and benchmark
    testing.]{style="font-weight:400;"}
3.  [Data Scientist at a senior level guiding the direction of a
    research, training program, and developing new methods for
    processing data.]{style="font-weight:400;"}

[- Our lab has representation from all three of these
categories.]{style="font-weight:400;"}

[- Some combination of internet-learning, buddy system, participating in
a community are all key aspects of learning bioinformatics skills that
seem to work for all of us.]{style="font-weight:400;"}

[- Buddy system. Many of us have found that forming connections with a
person or a community of people at a knowledgeable level to answer
questions has been necessary for our learning process. Community and
personal connections can be fostered via workshops, classes conferences,
social events, friendships.]{style="font-weight:400;"}

[- We have found good luck with using opportunities to collaborate,
asking for advice from experts when we meet them. The great thing about
this lab and knowing Titus is being able to take advantage of his
far-reaching network of collaborators.]{style="font-weight:400;"}

[- Internet-learning by Google searching. Stackoverflow is our
friend]{style="font-weight:400;"}

[- Some of us have chosen a good book,
e.g.]{style="font-weight:400;"}[[Practical Computing for
Biologists]{style="font-weight:400;"}](http://practicalcomputing.org/)[
by Haddock and Dunn, to read and go through the exercises on a regular
basis together with a group of people]{style="font-weight:400;"}

[- We’ve found it helpful to join a community to ask/answer questions.
We are actively working towards fostering such a community at UC Davis
via the DIB lab! See our website for training workshop schedule and to
sign-up for the email
list:]{style="font-weight:400;"}[[http://dib-training.readthedocs.io/en/pub/]{style="font-weight:400;"}](http://dib-training.readthedocs.io/en/pub/)

[- It has been our experience that significant investment of personal
time is required to learn.]{style="font-weight:400;"}

Here are our flip chart notes from this discussion:

**Sunday afternoon**

[The last afternoon discussion centered around lab culture hacking, i.e.
what are we doing well, what needs improvement. A motivational speech
from Titus: there are always going to be various things the lab can do
better, but generally, we're in a good place! The lab is a set of
opportunities. Choose your own adventure. If we’re not doing something,
we can provide resources to accomplish goals. Overall, his expectations
are for us to us do wonderful and unexpected things. Preferably multiple
wonderful things!]{style="font-weight:400;"}

[Then Titus left for an hour and a half while we discussed the lab.
Topics included more frequent journal club, more frequent project
reporting and scrum at every lab meeting (rather than one designated
presenter each meeting only presenting slides on their own research the
whole time), lab communication on Slack vs. email vs. Google calendar
for scheduling. The common theme was that while our projects are all
very different, we are all connected and the onus is on us to take more
initiative to communicate with one another. We talked about positive and
negative aspects of the lab. But generally concluded that our lab is
awesome, because of our strong community and diverse backgrounds of our
lab members. The meeting adjourned, with some of us returning to watch
the Super Bowl while others of us stayed on to play more Settlers of
Catan and Pictionary!]{style="font-weight:400;"}

[Thank you to [Yosemite Bug](http://www.yosemitebug.com/), for the
quiet, cozy, accommodating place for our group to stay and be productive
this weekend. It was a perfect, small venue for this
retreat.]{style="font-weight:400;"}

[Thank you, Titus for bringing us on this retreat. Thank you, everyone
in the DIB lab for being fun people. And thank you, [Moore
Foundation](https://www.moore.org/article-detail?newsUrlName=the-gordon-and-betty-moore-foundation-selects-awardees-for-$21-million-in-grants-to-stimulate-data-driven-discovery)
