When I plug my Samsung Galaxy 4 mobile android device into my laptop
running Ubuntu 13.04, I immediately get this error message:

I click 'OK'. It appears on my Devices list in both my file manager and
in Rhythmbox. I want to move music files onto this device. In Rhythmbox,
I select a group of files, drag them to the Device, let go, then I get
this error message:

This has happened at least 3 times now. There does not appear to be an
option to copy or save the whole or pieces (e.g. XorgLog or
XsessionErrors) of the error report. I'm unsure of what information is
useful to this situation and what is irrelevant.

Next step, search for problem "unable to mount device" on internet. If I
cannot find anything useful, then I will post to the Ubuntu help forum.
