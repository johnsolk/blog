Dr. Mike Zoday, Broad Institute (cont'd)- Metagenomics conclusion of
talk from Day 3.

Reproducility is an issue. Figure looking at different preps and
sequencing facilities.

Real change vs. real truth. Want to be able to measure changes.

Different filtering: Number of OTU gets higher with more reads with 454.

Read length important, the longer the more differences you can detect.
Read pairing is not as valuable as simply a longer read length.
