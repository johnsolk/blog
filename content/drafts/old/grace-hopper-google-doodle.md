Today's featured [Google Doodle is Grace
Hopper](http://www.google.com/doodles/grace-hoppers-107th-birthday)! My
dad, John E. Johnson, was a computer specialist for Sperry Univac for
&gt;30 yrs, worked with [Dr. Grace
Hopper](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/comic-riffs/post/grace-hopper-doodle-by-writing-computer-language-pioneering-grandma-cobol-helped-rewrite-the-history-books/2013/12/09/72a80e36-60bf-11e3-8beb-3f9a9942850f_blog.html)
when she was setting up UNIVAC I in 1951.Â They were both honored, among
many others, as "Pioneers" at the [1981 National Computer Conference in
Chicago](http://home.comcast.net/~sew1/Univac/doc/Staff.htm). Throughout
his career, my dad set up systems around the world and taught
programming and logic classes in COBOL and Fortran to workers before
Computer Science was a formal discipline taught in schools. As an early
colleague (and supervisor?), Grace Hopper probably influenced my dad.
When I was learning Pascal programming in high school, my dad helped and
encouraged me to study math and learn about computers beyond the
graphical user-interface. Via my dad, I like to think that I might have
learned something from Grace Hopper.

Thank you and Happy Birthday, Grace!
