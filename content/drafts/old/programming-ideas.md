Ideas for Python coding:  
- put sequences in fasta format

- parses sequences from fasta format

- reverse translate amino acid sequence

- search fasta file with EST for ORF

- search ncbi and pull fasta files for taxonomic groups and specific
genes

- primer melting temperature  
- GC content  
- molarity calculations, e.g.
http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/molarityform.cfm

- SOMETHING FUNCTIONAL: blast2go  
- upload a list of accessions  
- enrichment analysis to get a chart of significant functional groups
from a list of accessions

These require aligning:  
- primer alignments to source sequences  
- multiple alignments
