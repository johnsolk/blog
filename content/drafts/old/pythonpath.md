> Logical and neat directory structure will make your own, your
> computer's and your collaborators' lives much easier.
>
> **My recommendation:** Create a master code directory (called
> "Modules" or something) in your Documents folder. This will be the new
> home of all your future Python projects.

> Now every time you create a .py file, it should go into a project
> folder inside your Modules directory, i.e.
> /Documents/Modules/NewProject/MyModule.py. Note that you should have
> no actual modules inside your Modules directory! Keep those puppies in
> their warm, snuggly project subdirectories.
>
> This way you can also initialize that project folder (i.e.
> /NewProject) as a Git repository and just push and pull the contents
> to keep it up-to-date!
