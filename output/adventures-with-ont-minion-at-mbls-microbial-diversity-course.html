                <p>My time here at the <a href="http://www.mbl.edu/microbialdiversity/">Microbial Diversity
Course</a> at
<a href="http://www.mbl.edu/">MBL</a> has come to an end after visiting for the
past 2 weeks with our
<a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/lab/">lab's</a> <a href="https://www.nanoporetech.com/">MinION</a> to
sequence genomes from bacterial isolates that students collected from
the Trunk River in Woods Hole, MA. (Photo by Jared Leadbetter of
'Ectocooler' <em>Tenacibaculum</em> sp. isolated by Rebecca Mickol).</p>

<p>In <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/lab/">Titus Brown's DIB lab</a>, we've been
pretty excited about the Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION sequencer
for several reasons:</p>
<p>1) It's small and portable. This make the MinION a great teaching tool!
You can take it to workshops. Students can collect samples, extract DNA,
library prep, sequence, and learn to use assembly and annotation
bioinformatics software tools within the period of 1 week.</p>
<p>2.) We're interested in developing streaming software that's compatible
with the sequencing -&gt;  find what you want -&gt; stop sequencing
workflow.</p>
<p>3.) Long reads can be used in a similar way as PacBio data to resolve
genome and transcriptome (!) assemblies from existing  Illumina data.</p>
<p>Working with any new technology, especially from a new company, requires
troubleshooting. While <a href="https://twitter.com/astro_reid/status/756921430529437696">Twitter
posts</a> are
cool, they tend to make it seem very easy. There is a <a href="https://id.nanoporetech.com/idp/SSO.saml2?SAMLRequest=jZJbS8QwEIX%2FSt%2Fy1Da9uNbQFsouwsJ6Yas%2B%2BCIhnbKBJqmZRN1%2Fb1sRV0QR5mk435zDzJTI1TCyxruD3sOzB3RBgwjWSaPXRqNXYFuwL1LA%2FX5XkYNzI7I4FkYpr6U7RpprMxoLDsQhmtoxoom5QBJspmlS83nUFyi7n4Tsxrhtb6I5TEqC7aYiT2nCRc6BhnmWpyFNsjy8KFII6UoUILLzood%2BkiJ62Gp0XLuKpDRZhbQIk%2ByOnrGETvVIggewuERII0qCNzVoZLNTRbzVzHCUyDRXgMwJ1jZXOzYJGf%2Fcwiky%2Fs2M1jgjzEDqclazJZ2t%2F7kzBY533PEyPoXLjwtdT2bbza0ZpDgGzTCY17UF7qAiznogwaWxirvf4yVRsnRkF%2FaLlHmNIwjZS%2BhIXH%2BYfv%2BE%2Bh0%3D&amp;SigAlg=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2F09%2Fxmldsig%23rsa-sha1&amp;Signature=dofUEmqdicPrEt%2FXW8%2F9v128VbkByVeCVCbI9peAI82jNGKCNXUmqD%2FjqWk8ILbgQSkrKsSh56M70uyFZzlAXRMtbG4ayFl8FrcLsm1TTbgGhhmeGIc31qpyOmmFg8kadnBBx7g8xtKP%2BDIy%2BzU98soLzLsR0hSjrxgvLFT3NRuk4gNsyDhAtAWJEHjD5lBz5RSCgVvXNP8T93WBmgvY0mAgM5X2M9chh%2B92Rr78LBxGIUFTe7KHKOAFzV5HKchri6dkJeE3j0AQwksGR6HJ6G1rFrTjXUrFVw6e76RtSbnPsBe20c5hBXS1ZWmRF%2BKCzVJyRN316XsbLy0N6QENQA%3D%3D">MAP

MinION users, but a login is required and public searching is not
possible. In comparison to Illumina sequencing, there is not that much
experience out there yet.</p>
<p><strong>Acknowledgements</strong></p>
<p>These are usually saved for the end, but since this is a long blog post,
thought I would front-load on the gratitude.</p>
<p>I have really benefitted from blog posts from <a href="http://omicsomics.blogspot.com/2016/08/sometimes-its-more-about-1d-journey.html">Keith
Robison</a>
and <a href="http://lonelyjoeparker.com/wp/?p=1313">lonelyjoeparker</a>. <a href="http://lab.loman.net/2016/07/30/nanopore-r9-data-release/">Nick
Loman and Josh Quick's
experiences</a> have
also been beneficial.</p>
<p>There is no match, though, for having people in person to talk to about
technical challenges. <a href="http://www.dennislab.org/">Megan Dennis</a> and
Maika Malig at UC Davis have provided amazing supportive guidance for us
in the past few months with lab space and sharing their own experiences
with the MinION. I'm very grateful to be at UC Davis and working with
Megan.</p>
<p>This trip was made possible by support from my PI, Titus Brown, who
provided funding for my trip and all the flowcells and reagents for the
MinION sequencing. It was necessary to have this 2 week block of time to
focus on nothing else but getting the MinION to work, ask questions, and
figure out what works (and what doesn't).</p>
<p>Special thanks to Rebecca Mickol and Kirsten Grond in the Microbial
Diversity course for isolating and culturing the super cool bacterial
samples. Scott Dawson at UC Davis (faculty at the Microbial Diversity
course) was instrumental in helping with DNA extractions. Jessica Mizzi
assisted with library prep protocol development and
troubleshooting. <a href="http://halexand.github.io/">Harriet Alexander</a>
assisted with the assembly, library prep and showing me around Woods
Hole, which is a lovely place to visit. Thank you also to the MBL
Microbial Diversity Course, Hilary Morrison and the Bay Paul Center for
hosting lab space for this work to take place.</p>

<p>Immediately following the Woods Hole visit at MBL, I went to the MSU
Kellogg Biological Station as a TA for <a href="http://angus.readthedocs.io/en/2016/">NGS 2016
course</a> and wrote a tutorial for
analyzing ONP data:</p>
<p>http://angus.readthedocs.io/en/2016/analyzing_nanopore_data.html</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/monsterbashseq/status/758712607763292165</p>
<p><strong>Purchasing and Shipping</strong></p>
<p>Advice: allow 2-3 months for ordering. We ordered one month in advance.
While ONP customer service probably worked overtime to send our
flowcells and Mk1B after several emails, chats, and calling in special
favors, in the future it is unclear whether we can count on a scheduled
delivery with students. Communication required \~dozen emails and we
could never get confirmation that flowcells would arrive in time for the
course. It turns out that our order had been shipped and arrived on
time, however we did not know about it because a tracking number was not
sent to us. It took about a day of emailing and waiting to track the
boxes down. Thankfully, the boxes were stored properly in the MBL
shipping warehouse.</p>
<p>Communicate with ONP constantly. Stay on top of shipments, ask for
tracking numbers and confirmation of shipment. Find out where the
shipment is being delivered, as the address you've entered may not be
the one on the shipping box and your order will be delivered to the
wrong place.</p>
<p><strong>Flowcells</strong></p>
<p>QC the flowcells immediately. Bubbles are bad:</p>
<p>https://www.flickr.com/photos/lpcohen/27996712883/in/dateposted-friend/</p>
<p>We ordered 7 flowcells (5 + 2 that came with the starter pack).The flow
cells seemed to have inconsistent pore numbers and some arrived with
bubbles. One flow cell had zero pores. They sent us a replacement for
this flowcell within days, which was very helpful. However, for the
flowcells that had bubbles, I was given instructions by ONP technical
staff to draw back a small 15 ul vol of fluid to try to remove the
bubble, then QC again. This did not work. The performance of these
flowcells did not meet our expectations.</p>
<p>In communicating with the company, we were told that there was no
warranty on the flowcells.</p>
<p><strong>DNA Extractions</strong></p>
<p>The ONP protocol says that at least  500-1000 ng clean DNA is required
for successful library prep. Try to aim for more than this. Try to get
as much DNA, as high molecular weight as possible. Be careful with your
DNA. Do not mix liquids by pipetting. For the bacterial isolates from
liquid culture, Scott Dawson recommended using Qiagen size exclusion
columns to purify, and this worked really well for us. We started with
\~2000 ug and used the FFPE repair step.</p>
<p>The ONP protocol includes shearing with the <a href="http://covarisinc.com/products/g-tube/">Covaris
gtube</a> to 8kb. When I eliminated
this step to preserve longer strands, there was little to no yield and
samples with adequate yield had poor sequencing results. In
communicating with ONP about this, we suspected that the strands were
shearing on their own somewhere during the multiple reactions, then
either getting washed away during the bead cleanup steps, or the tether
and hairpin adapters were sheared off so the strands were not being
recognized by the pores.</p>
<p>We sequenced all three sets of DNA below (ladder 1-10kb). The Maxwell
prep (gel below on the left) had a decent library quantity but the
sequencing read lengths were not as long as we would have liked, which
makes sense given the small smeary bands seen. (<a href="https://github.com/ljcohen/dib_ONP_MinION/blob/master/Ectocooler/Ectocooler_poretools_report_July31_2016.ipynb">poretools

<p><strong>Library prep</strong></p>
<p>When we first started troubleshooting the MinION, the protocols
available through the MAP were difficult to follow in the lab. We needed
a sheet to just print out and follow from the bench, so we created this:</p>
<p>https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EvxAyJFRu96_caWBEpCcQc7rfRV_Zm1LudScZA8lWCU/edit?usp=sharing</p>
<p>A few months ago, ONP came out with a pdf checklist for library prep,
which is great:</p>
<p>https://github.com/ljcohen/dib_ONP_MinION/blob/master/protocols_manuals/ONP_MinION_lib_prep_protocol_SQK-NSK007.pdf</p>
<p>The library prep is pretty straight forward. One important thing I
learned about the <a href="https://www.neb.com/products/m0367-blunt-ta-ligase-master-mix">NEB Blunt/TA Master
Mix</a>:</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/monsterbashseq/status/760603605099540481</p>
<p>Library prep and loading samples onto the flowcell can be tricky and
nerve wracking for those who are not comfortable with lab work. I have
&gt;4 yrs of molecular lab experience knowing how to treat reagents,
quick spins, pipetting small volumes, how to be careful not to waste
reagents. One important point to convey to those who do not do molecular
lab work often, is the viscous, sticky enzyme mixes that come in
glycerol. You think you're sucking up a certain volume, but an <em>equal
amount</em> is often stuck to the outside of your pipette tip. You have to
wipe it on the side of the tube to get it off so you don't add this
to your rxn volume, changing the optimal concentration and (probably the
most important) also wasting reagent.</p>
<p>Other misc. advice:</p>
<ul>
<li>The calculation: M1V1 = M2V2 is your friend.</li>
<li>Don't mix by pipetting.</li>
<li>Instead, tap or flick the tube with care.</li>
<li>Quick spin your tubes often to ensure liquid is collected down at
    the bottom.</li>
<li>Bead cleanups require patience and care while pipetting.</li>
<li>Be really organized with your tubes (since there are a handful of
    reagent tubes that all look the same). Use a checklist and cross off
    each time you have added a reagent.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the things I take for granted when I'm doing lab work on a
regular basis. It takes a while to remember when I'm in the lab again
after taking a hiatus to work on computationally-focused projects.</p>

<p><strong>Computer Hardware</strong></p>
<p>In October 2015 last year when we were ordering everything to get set
up, the computer hardware requirements for the MinION were: 8GB RAM and
128 SSD harddrive with i7 CPU. This is what we ended up ordering (which
took several weeks to special order from the UC Davis computer tech
center):</p>
<p><em>DH Part#: F1M35UT Manufacturer: HP Mfr #: F1M35UT#ABA HP ZBook 15 G2

One run requires around 30-50 GB, depending on the quality of the run.
The .fast5 files are large, even though the resulting .fastq are small
(&lt;1 GB). The hard-drive on our MinION laptop is 256 GB, which can
fill up fast. We bought a 2 TB external hard-drive, which we can
configure Metrichor to download the reads to after basecalling, saving
space on the laptop hard-drive.

**Software and Data**

</div>

<ul>
<li>Windows sucks</li>
<li>There's a new GUI (graphical user interface) for MinKnow in the past
    months. It's annoying to get used to this, but in general not too
    bad.</li>
<li>The poretools software to convert .fast5 to .fastq is buggy on
    Windows and does not play well with MinKnow. There's probably a way
    to get them both to work, but I've already spent \~2-4 hrs of
    troubleshooting this issue, so am done with this for now. Instead,
    we've been uploading .fast5 to a Linux server, then running
    poretools on there.</li>
<li>MinKnow python scripts crash sometimes during the run! You can open
    the MinKnow software again, start the script again, and it should
    start the run from where it left off.</li>
<li>Use the 48 hr MinKnow script for sequencing.</li>
<li>Our flow of data goes from raw signal from the MinION (<strong>laptop</strong>)
    -&gt; upload to <strong>Metrichor server</strong> for basecalling -&gt; download
    to <strong>external hard-drive</strong> ("pass" or "fail" depending on the
    Metrichor workflow chosen, e.g. 1D or 2D or barcoding) -&gt; plug
    external hard-drive to Linux or Linux laptop (for some reason this
    is easier on Linux laptop rather than Windows...) for transfer to
    <strong>Linux server</strong> -&gt; on the Linux server, run poretools software
    to convert to fastq/fasta -&gt; analysis</li>
<li>This all seems kind of ridiculous. If there is a better way, please
    let us know!</li>

<p><strong>Workshops</strong></p>
<p>In a future workshop setting, where students are doing this for the
first time but we have more experience now, a potential schedule could
go something like this:</p>
<p>[Day 1:]{style="text-decoration:underline;"} Collect sample, culture</p>
<p>[Day 2:]{style="text-decoration:underline;"} Extract DNA, run on gel,
quantify</p>
<p>[Day 3:]{style="text-decoration:underline;"} Library prep, sequence
(this will be a long day)</p>
<p>[Day 4:]{style="text-decoration:underline;"} Get sequences, upload,
assess reads, start assembly</p>
<p>[Day 5:]{style="text-decoration:underline;"} Evaluate assembly, Annotate</p>
<p>This is similar to the schedule arranged for Pore Camp, run by Nick
Loman at the University of Birmingham in the UK. They have some great
materials and experiences to share:</p>
<p>http://porecamp.github.io/</p>
<p><strong>Cost</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Still unknown what the cost is per sample.</li>
<li>Cost of troubleshooting?</li>
</ul>
<p>I've put together a quick ONP MinION purchasing sheet:</p>
<p>https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yBncz75kgwExCXy7sC9LsMaDGs8OJJJGg9f4o3DcoQE/edit?usp=sharing</p>
<p>Generally, these are the items to purchase:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mk1B starter pack  came with 2 flowcells</li>
<li>computer</li>
<li>ONP reagents</li>
<li>third-party reagents (NEB)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Getting Help</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>MAP community has some answers</li>
<li>There is no phone number to call ONP. In contrast, Illumina has a
    fantastic customer service phone line, with well-trained technicians
    on the other end to answer emergency phone calls. Reagents and
    flowcells are expensive. When you're in the lab and there is a
    problem, like a bubble on the flowcell or a low pore number after
    QC, it is often necessary to call and talk to a person on the phone
    to ask question so you don't waste time or money.</li>
<li>I've had many good email conversations with ONP tech support, but
    there is no substitute to calling someone on the phone and
    discussing a problem. Often, there are things to work on after the
    email and it is difficult to follow up by going back and forth with
    email.</li>
<li>LiveChatting feature on the <a href="https://www.nanoporetech.com/">ONP
    website</a> is great! (During UK
    business hours, there is a feature at the bottom of the store
    website that says "Do you have a question?". During off hours it
    says "Leave a message".</li>
</ul>
<p>I realized through this process that I had lots questions and few
answers. The MAP has lots of forum questions but few manuals. Phrase
searching sucks. If you search for a phrase in quotes, it will still
search for individual words. For example:</p>
<p><img alt="MAP_failed_script_search.png" src="https://monsterbashseq.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/map_failed_script_search.png">{.alignnone
.wp-image-3325 width="474" height="279"}</p>
<p><strong>Remaining Questions:</strong></p>
<p><em>1. Why does the number of flow cell pores fluctuate? What is the
optimal pore number for a flow cell?</em></p>
<p><em>2. What is the effect of 1D reads on the assembly? Can we use the
"failed" reads for anything? </em></p>
<p><em>3. How long will a run take? </em></p>
<p><em>4. How much hard-disk space is required for one run?</em></p>
<p><em>5. When are the reads "passing" and when are they "failing"? Is there
value to the failing reads? </em></p>
<p><em>6. How can we get the most out of the flow cells?</em> There seem to be a
lot of unknowns related to the efficiency of the flowcells. We tried
re-using a washed flow cell. There were &gt;400 pores in the flow cell
during the initial QC. After we loaded the library and started the run,
the pore numbers were in the 80s-100s. 2 hrs later, this number dropped
down to \~30s. I added more library, and the pore numbers never
increased again. Is this a result of the pore quality degrading? The
next morning, loaded more library again. Not much change. Decided to
switch flowcells and try a new one.</p>
<p><em>7. Are there batch effects of library prep and/or flowcells? Should we
be wary of combining reads from multiple flowcells?</em></p>
<p><strong>Future</strong></p>
<p>In the future, the aim is to move away worrying about the technology
details and focus on the data analysis and what the data mean. The goal
should be to focus on the biology and why we're interested in sequencing
anything and everything. What can we do with all of this information,
now that we can sequence a genome of a new bacterial species in a week?</p>
