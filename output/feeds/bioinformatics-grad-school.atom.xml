Bioinformatics. There are not many schools who offer a PhD degree
specifically in this field. Computational, systems biology, genetics,
molecular biology - many schools have programs and offer specializations
in the area of bioinformatics. Schools with Core Genomics Facilities
have faculty who specialize in bioinformatics because there is a need.
I'm interested in exploring any options that might be available. This
reminds me of the &lt;a href="http://rbaltman.wordpress.com/2009/02/18/bioinformatics-computational-biology-same-no/"&gt;discussion of differences between fields of
bioinformatics and computational
biology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my searching, I came across this YouTube video from Nature Videos
about the ENCODE project at EMBL-EBI. I enjoy how it depicts scientists
studying genome sequences and intraspecies variation, looking at
variable pieces of genes being sent through tubes.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other videos from Nature are good too. I like seeing animations of these
molecular-scale processes that I would otherwise just have to visualize
in my head.&lt;/p&gt;
