&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://theconversation.com/new-genetically-engineered-american-chestnut-will-help-restore-the-decimated-iconic-tree-52191"&gt;This very well-written
article&lt;/a&gt;
by &lt;a href="http://www.esf.edu/EFB/powell/"&gt;Dr. William Powell&lt;/a&gt; from SUNY
Syracuse explains that the population of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_chestnut"&gt;America chestnut
trees, &lt;em&gt;Castanea
dentata&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the
eastern U.S. was invaded starting in the early 1900s by a fungal
pathogen, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chestnut_blight"&gt;Cryphonectria
parasitica&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;causing a
lethal disease called chestnut blight. &lt;a href="http://www.landscapeimagery.com/chestnut.html"&gt;The population was wiped out,
once a dominant canopy ranging from Maine to
FL&lt;/a&gt;. American chestnuts
are large trees, of ecological importance providing habitat for
thousands of other species and also providing a source of &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112709002837"&gt;carbon
sequestration&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.acf.org/"&gt;Efforts
to restore&lt;/a&gt; this environmentally- and
economically-important species have recently focused on using
biotechnology methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is really great to see the application of transgenic
technologies used for environmental restoration purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transgenic plant was created by adding a single gene from the wheat
plant. Thirty candidate genes were tested for effectiveness in removing
the fungus. The best turned out to one that produces an enzyme called
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxalate_oxidase"&gt;oxalate oxidase (OxO)&lt;/a&gt;,
which breaks down &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxalate"&gt;oxalate&lt;/a&gt; that
the fungus uses to form deadly cankers on the stems. The American
Chestnut Research and Restoration Project has a l&lt;a href="http://www.esf.edu/chestnut/genes.htm"&gt;ist of reasons why OxO
was chosen as the best gene&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experiment done to test the effectiveness of the OxO gene is shown
here in this video, comparing the "wild-type" normal American chestnut
plant on the left to the new transgenic chestnut plants:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://youtu.be/Ty9b1vml5IQ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is a blight-resistant American chestnut tree that can pass
this trait down to the next generation. The idea is to cross with
cultured chestnut trees allowing the trait to incorporate and diversify,
then plant into the wild and hopefully restore the population.&lt;/p&gt;

'Biotechnology Fundamentals and Applications' by &lt;a href="http://ucd-advance.ucdavis.edu/profile/denneal-jamison-mcclung"&gt;Dr. Denneal
Jamison-McClung&lt;/a&gt;,
which is required for my degree with a designated emphasis in
biotechnology (DEB). (This is like a doctoral minor. It will show up on
my diploma and my transcript.) This course will cover some of the
history, basic molecular biology and chemical engineering topics
relevant in the biotechnology field right now. In addition, we'll be
working in an interdisciplinary team to build a business plan towards
developing a theoretical biotechnology product. AND, we will practice
science communication across disciplines!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were given an assignment to post 4 tweets during the quarter with
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23MCB263&amp;amp;src=tyah&amp;amp;lang=en"&gt;#MCB263&lt;/a&gt; on a
topic relevant to the course, then summarize our reasoning for posting
and topics posted by members of our group. The idea is to help us
brainstorm ideas with our groups for developing our biotechnology
product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this week, here is my post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://twitter.com/monsterbashseq/status/686239215923773441&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a retweet from &lt;a href="http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/44931/title/Cell-free-Protein-Synthesis/"&gt;The
Scientist&lt;/a&gt; about a
group from the &lt;a href="https://www.ornl.gov/"&gt;Oak Ridge National
Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; who recently published a &lt;a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smll.201502764/full"&gt;report in
the journal
&lt;em&gt;Small&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
on their progress with developing an on-demand protein synthesis and
delivery system. I chose to post about this for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is that this system - once working - could be used to treat
diseases that require a single protein, e.g. Type I diabetes where the
patient is unable to produce their own insulin as a result of autoimmune
dysfunction attacking pancreatic beta islet cells. Current treatment of
Type I diabetes requires delivery of insulin produced by recombinant
technologies. This requires a company to manufacture insulin, which then
has to be shipped, refrigerated, and delivered. Drawbacks from this
include being dependent on a company to manufacture the insulin, storage
temps requiring refrigeration, and then management of deliver or 'how do
I get the insulin in my body?' Usually, needles or pump with infusion
set requiring periodic injection to create a port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new microfluidics system means that all you need is the bioreactor
system stuck onto to the skin of the patient. (or inside?) The insulin
is manufactured on demand and relies on diffusion of endogenous amino
acids and metabolites across a nanoporous membrane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, this technology is interesting because it could possibly be used
to manufacture and deliver many different small proteins, e.g. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropeptide#Examples"&gt;peptide
neurotransmitters&lt;/a&gt; to
a biological system. This could allow researchers to study the effects
of these small proteins on a biological time scale without having to
inject the molecules at specific - possibly ineffectual - time periods.
There are neuropeptides, e.g. hypothalamic neuropeptides such as
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropeptide_Y"&gt;NPY&lt;/a&gt; that regulate
metabolism that may be beneficial to be synthesized and delivered on
demand. Scientists can figure out when the demand is occurring, rather
than having to guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is all really cool and has the potential to revolutionize
the level at which the medical field is able to treat metabolic
diseases, neuropathies, and aging.&lt;/p&gt;
