While we're working with it and generating new Illumina PE150 data for each species, we wanted to share this information and data. Since there are not many PromethION instruments out there, to my knowledge, these data are probably some of the first of its kind to be shared, besides human data . Questions for the community The purpose of this blog post is mainly to share our plan, seek advice, and see if anyone is interested in these data. Would anyone be interested in collaborating with us on an assemblathon -like project with these ONT data to come up with some best-practices? If so, please contact me! ( twitter or email ) We're generating these ONT data for the purpose of assembling reference genomes for organisms where we already have a closely-related (5-20 million years diverged) genome from a sister species, ( Fundulus heteroclitus ) . We're in the process of generating Illumina data to improve the consensus. By today's standards of genome assembly , this project is not the most sophisticated. We're not planning to do anything fancy to improve the scaffolding with optical and chromatin interaction mapping. Just quick and dirty genomes for around $3500 each. This is also by no means a perfect data set by ONT standards. Our DNA samples - from all species - have consistently not been utilizing the pores as efficiently as possible on either MinION or PromethION flowcells, despite using fresh tissue and troubleshooting efforts with different DNA extraction and cleanup methods. Therefore, our yields from ONT sequencing have not been as high as other groups have gotten. But, from our experience, this is what can happen when new species are sequenced with a new technology. Despite these shortcomings, 20-30Gb/species ONT data are great to have! Better than Illumina data alone. Since this is a new type of ONT data from the PromethION, we're in unchartered territory here about some things. What does one do with the millions of raw fast5 signal files from the PromethION? Our basecalled fastq are 70-100 GB, but the directory of raw fast5 signal files is >600 GB for each run! Wow. To our knowledge, the only software that uses these files to polish the reads is Nanopolish by Jared Simpson's group . Since the files are so large, I haven't tried using Nanopolish yet. It it a good idea to try? What is the best way to share >600 GB of millions of fast5 files with people who might be interested in using it? Data are unfiltered. Should we remove DNA CS lambda phage spike-in before sharing in a public repository? What is the best way to look for reads suspected as errors (>900 Mb)? Should these be removed before sharing in a public repository? What is the best workflow and tools to use for assembly with ONT and Illumina data? Where is the best place to share these sequencing data? Even though zenodo has recently upgraded their file size limits to 50 GB , it is not a good place to store these data based on their response to my request: Any other advice, questions, or comments on things that perhaps we are not considering? Our plan from here: 1. Post data to a public nucleic acid repository European Nucleotide Archive (ENA)-EBI or SRA-NCBI? (I will post links to the records here once they are available.) What to do with the raw fast5 signal files? 2. Write a data note Either F1000 research or GigaScience 3. Use the genome assemblies! The ultimate goal is to do some comparative genomics analyses between these genomes, use them as references for RNAseq data, and scan for regulatory regions of interest, e.g. salinity-responsive enhancing elements (OSRE) Thank you! This is a collaborative effort between my two advisors, Dr. Titus Brown and Dr. Andrew Whitehead. (Seriously, I can't believe how fortunate I am to have two such supportive advisors and a willingly collaborative network of lab members and colleagues.) Other contributors to this project have been Dr. Ruta Madhusudan and Tony Gill . Special thanks to instructors at PoreCamp, Texas , Dr. Charlie Johnson and Dr. Richard Metz at Texas A&M Agrilife Research Sequencing Facility (where PoreCamp was held) for Illumina NovaSeq data from Fundulus olivaceus ). THANK YOU to Dr. David Duvernell at Missouri University of Science & Technology and Dr. Jake Schaefer at the University of Southern Mississippi for sending us all of these fish to us, live! All of this is made possible by funding support from the Moore Foundation Data-Driven-Discovery investigator award to Dr. Titus Brown. Below is a bit of background on the project, methods, preliminary results, references, and a list of some tools I've compiled. New PromethION instrument at the UC Davis Genome Center In May 2018 , the UC Davis Genome Center received its PromethION from Oxford Nanopore! This was part of a collaborative effort to acquire this instrument through the PromethION early release program (PEAP) back in early 2016 by Genome Center faculty: Dr. Richard Michelmore , Dr. Megan Dennis (who is on my dissertation committee!), Dr. Luis Carvajal-Carmona , and Dr. Titus Brown . When I began my PhD proram in 2015, I started working with the ONT MinION to see if it is feasible to use for genome assemblies of eukaryotic organisms. It turns out that it is not, at least for these killifish. To achieve 30-50x coverage for a genome assembly of a 1-1.1 Gb killifish genome, we would need to use 30-50 MinION flowcells. At a cost of $800-900/flowcell , that is not a reasonably affordable genome ($24,000-45,000). Whereas it took 39 flowcells to get ~30x (90Gb) coverage of the human genome , one PromethION flowcells has sequenced ~80x coverage of human genome . PromethION promises higher yield than MinION, allowing it to be more feasible for larger genomes >1 Gb. The cost of one PromethION run at UC Davis is $2,880. As you see below, we have not achieved this high of a yield on Promethtion, but we have at least achieved 20-30x coverage of our killifish genomes. The avalance of data commences! Four species of Fundulus killifish These species of killifish have never been sequenced before. We have a genome for the classic laboratory and field model species, Fundulus heteroclitus for understanding how organisms and populations interact with the external environment. But we do not have any genomic information from other important related freshwater species of Fundulus . Why killifish? The Fundulus heteroclitus killifish has been well-studied because of its physiological resilience to environmental change. It has also been found to have rapidly evolved to polluted environments . I am most interested in the Fundulus as a flexible model for resilience to salinity change. While F. heteroclitus is flexible to salinity change, some of its sister species are not. The physiological requirement for high (or low) concentrations of salt ions in the water has affected geographic distributions of aquatic animals throughout evolutionary history and will continue to impact species worldwide in view of future changes in climate. To study the history of adaptation to different salinities and understand the mechanisms of evolution at the molecular level, we have been studying this group of related killifish from the genus Fundulus , which contains species that are natively adapted to different salinities. Some Fundulus species tolerate a range of salinities (euryhaline) while others require a more narrow salinity range (stenohaline) in either fresh or marine waters. Unique to this family of killifish is evidence that some species from the genus Fundulus have radiated into fresh water bodies on three separate, parallel occasions between 5-25 million years ago, and have lost their ability to tolerate higher salinities like their euryhaline relatives. We use Fundulus as a comparative model system for studying the physiological and genetic mechanisms that diverge between euryhaline and stenohaline freshwater species. Whitehead et al. 2010. Phylogeny of killifish osmotic tolerance. Whitehead et al. 2011. Genomic mechanisms of evolved physiological plasticity in killifish distributed along an environmental salinity gradient. Brennan et al. 2015. Reciprocal osmotic challenges reveal mechanisms of divergence in phenotypic plasticity in the killifish Fundulus heteroclitus. Brennan et al. 2018. Integrative Population and Physiological Genomics Reveals Mechanisms of Adaptation in Killifish. DNA extractions Live samples were shipped to UC Davis by Dr. David Duvernell and Dr. Jake Schaefer . When possible (all but Fundulus catenatus), samples were extracted from fresh tissue. Fish heads were used for high molecular weight (hmw) DNA extractions. Ultra-long read sequencing protocol by Josh Quick and Nick Loman Agilent #200600 DNA extraction kit found by Tony Tony Gil and I found that fresh is better than frozen With Dr. Ruta, we tried Qiagen - p. 39 \"DNA purification from tissue using the Gentra puregene Tissue Kit\" DNA was difficult to get into solution. (show pic) Dr. Ruta found that adding urea to lysis buffer helped the final DNA pellet to be less brittle and go into solution easier Wasko et al. 2003 Something weird with our samples. ONT has mentioned that this could a fish-specific sample issue, based on experiences with other customers. Has anyone else found this to be the case with fish hmw DNA? Brittle and breaking easily?

Video: Some Background I've had a blog that I started when I was first learning and developing computational skills. Wordpress blogs are great for quickly publishing a post, with capacity for formatting pictures and links to Tweets. At the encouragement of Titus a few years ago during our summer DIBSI workshop , I started taking notes on the online collaborative document site, hackmd.io . This cool site lets you write in markdown and immediately see it rendered. The link can be shared with collaborators, and the document can be exported to .pdf , .html , or .md formats. I started writing all of my notes with markdown. But then wanting to write a blog post with my notes? Manually converting .md documents and code chunks into the online wordpress user interface is tedious. This week, I casually mentioned that I wanted to migrate from wordpress to a more markdown-friendly format for my blog. Luiz immediately chimed in that Pelican is great! And uses it for his blog . It turns out that Titus' blog and other lab mate, Charles Reid both have their blogs in Pelican as well. One of the many advantages of Pelican is that it is written in Python, unlike Jekyll which is written in Ruby. (I'm more comfortable coding and debugging in Python than in Ruby.) And Charles provided lots of documentation on how to use Pelican! It's great to be in a lab group where people have such useful and encouraging advice. Tutorial We started with the tutorial from Charles Reid , which has practice content . Make a working directory for your blog: mkdir blog cd blog/ git init Get the configuration file, pelicanconf.py : wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/charlesreid1/magic-flying-pelican/master/pelican/pelicanconf.py mkdir content cd content/ Navigate to some of the example posts and download: wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/charlesreid1/magic-flying-pelican/master/pelican/content/posts/hello-world-1.md Taking a look, we see that each .md post file must have this header: Title : Hello world number one Date : 2018 - 05 - 13 22 : 00 Category : Python Tags : pelican Author : charlesreid1 Summary : First hello world post Now we have to install Pelican and markdown. Luiz uses pipenv . This will activate a new virtualenv with pelican and markdown available without messing with dependencies in your computer's $PATH. pip install --user pipenv export PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH pipenv install pelican markdown pipenv shell Now we need some Pelican themes . (All themes are downloaded, so put them in a different location.) cd ../../ git clone --recursive https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes cd pelican-themes pelican-themes -i bootstrap Change the path location of the theme in the pelicanconf.py file: cd blog cp -a ../pelican-themes/bootstrap theme vi pelicanconf.py Specify the path where the theme will be saved to (this was copied with the command above). THEME = './theme' Change other information, such as your name and site name and site url in the pelicanconf.py file. wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/charlesreid1/magic-flying-pelican/master/pelican/content/posts/hello-world-1.md mkdir posts mv hello-world-1.md posts/ mv hello-world-1.md 2018-09-05.md vi 2018-09-05.md Then run: pelican This will produce output like this: WARNING : Removed extraneous trailing slash from SITEURL . Done : Processed 2 articles , 0 drafts , 0 pages and 0 hidden pages in 0.55 seconds . Check how it looks: python -m http.server (Go to http://localhost:8000/output/ ) At anytime, you can remove the output/ directory, because this is what is generated when running pelican . rm -rf output/ Hosting on github.io Add/commit changes, then set up a repository on GitHub (don't initialize with README.md ) to add as remote. git add --all git status git commit -m \"first commit\" git remote add origin https://github.com/ljcohen/blog.git git push -u origin master Install ghp-import: pipenv ghp - import pipenv install ghp - import git status git diff ghp - import which ghp - import ghp - import -- help ghp - import pelican pelican ghp - import output git branch ghp - import - p output Using travis-ci Make a travis .yml file: vi .travis.yml With this content: language : python dist : xenial python : '3.6' branches : only : - master install : - pip install pipenv - pipenv install script : - pipenv run pelican deploy : provider : pages skip - cleanup : true local - dir : output github - token : $GITHUB_TOKEN # Set in the settings page of your repository on : branch : master Add/commit: git add .travis.yml git commit -m \"added travis-ci\" git push -u origin master Go to travis-ci and login to GitHub. Set up your personal access tokens on your GitHub account. Go to 'Settings', 'Integration & services' in the GitHub repository to configure Travis CI with a key to give push access.
