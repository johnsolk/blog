                <p>Authors: Lisa K. Johnson and Sara Edge</p>
<p>This blog post was inspired by attending the <a href="https://gigaiii.weebly.com/">Global Invertebrate Genomics Alliance (GIGA) conference</a> in Curaçao (Oct. 19-21, 2018). There is a <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jhered/article/105/1/1/858593">paucity of invertebrate sequencing information available</a>, especially for Poriferans. Invertebrate genomes and transcriptomes allow us to better understand global biodiversity towards conservation efforts.</p>
<p>This is raw RNA-seq data and an assembled transcriptome that has been sitting on servers since 2013. We want to release it so that perhaps this can help anyone who is interested.</p>
<p>Writing manuscripts for publication is time consuming. Submitting raw reads and transcriptomes to ENA or NCBI, SRA and TSA is also time consuming and confusing. Since this is an old project that is not related to my dissertation research, instead of spending valuable research time on these efforts, we make these data and information available.</p>
<p>Link to the data: <a href="https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/B972E">https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/B972E</a></p>

<p>Eventually, we would like to write and submit. GIGA provides a <a href="http://giga-cos.org/">central resource</a> for submitting these data as well. I should probably release these data there as well. In the meantime, here you go! If you are interested, please get in touch. Advice and comments welcome below for the time when we do work towards a publishable manuscript. In particular, what additional information, analysis and discussion would be needed with these data that would be required for an original and useful publication in this field? </p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Porifera are among the major phyla inhabiting marine hard substrate benthos, in terms of number of species and biomass (Carballo et al. 1996). As sessile filter-feeders, sponges are sensitive to stressors and thus are important indicator species of environmental perturbations (Carballo et al., 1996; Bachinski et al., 1997).</p>
<p>Gene expression profiling has been used as a method for identifying suites of genes in functional pathways expressed under certain controlled conditions in reef-building corals (Edge et al. 2005) and verified as a tool to detect similar sub-lethal responses from ex situ environmental coral samples (Edge et al. 2012, Edge et al. 2008). Applying similar gene expression profiling methods to sponges under controlled conditions, such as exposure to oil and dispersant, could assist resource managers in monitoring the effects of these stressors on reef sponges. </p>
<p>The experiment aimed to assess the responses of a single sponge species following exposure to oil with a similar composition to the MC252 Macondo wellhead after the Deepwater Horizon event and to the dispersant used during clean-up efforts.</p>
<p>A reference <em>de novo</em> transcriptome was assembled and annotated for <em>Aiolochroia crassa</em>. This sequence information is the first from this species (aside from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?id=261677">25 NCBI nucleotide records</a>). </p>
<p><strong>TO DO: check to see if these genes are repsented in the transcriptome</strong>.</p>
<h1>Methods</h1>
<p>Fragments from six <em>Aiolocroia crassa</em> sponge colonies were collected from a Ft. Lauderdale reef and transported to the aquaculture facility at Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute at Florida Atlantic University within two hours of collection (29 May 2012). Sponges were maintained in aerated raceways with filtered and UV-sterilized seawater (32 ppt, 28◦C) pumped from the Indian River Lagoon. Each sponge colony was cut into twelve pieces (4-6 cm2) resulting in 72 fragments. Colored plastic zip ties were used to identify sponge colonies and secure fragments to twelve 20 cm by 45 cm PVC grids (Figure 1). </p>

Figure 1. Sponge fragments from each parent colony attached to PVC grid and assigned a unique colored cable tie for identification. One grid per tank x 12 tanks, four treatment groups x 3 replicates per treatment.</p>
<h3>Experimental Exposures</h3>
<p>After 24 hours of acclimation, fragmented sponges were placed into twelve 5 gallon aquaria filled with 15 L of UV-treated seawater. Aquaria were randomly distributed between two aquaculture raceways. There were four treatment groups, each replicated three times, in a randomized block experimental design.</p>
<p>Treatments consisted of exposure to 100 ppm oil and 10 ppm dispersant (Corexit 9500A, Nalco) (OD), oil and no dispersant (OC), dispersant and no oil (UD) and a control (UC). Oil used for the experiment was a fresh oil/source sample collected by Cardno ENTRIX for British Petroleum from near the MS252 Macondo wellhead (Coordinates: 28.866014, -88.056264, Sample ID: SO-20110212-HMPA4-003) on 12 February 2011. A 3,000 ppm stock solution of oil was made by mixing with sea water and stirring continuously on low heat for 18 hrs. Oil concentration was based on previously-published experiments (Epstein et al. 2000, Dodge et al 1984, Cook and Knap 1983) and dispersant concentration was based on the Environmental Protection Agency’s recommended application range (dispersant to oil ratio of 1:50 to 1:10, EPA).</p>
<p>Environmental conditions were consistent throughout the exposures. Salinity was adjusted to 32 ppt in each tank using Instant Ocean® while temperature was maintained at approximately 28◦C. During the exposure period, tank chemistry, including dissolved oxygen, pH, salinity, and temperature, were recorded three times daily. Additionally, 80% of the water in all aquaria was replaced and the same concentrations of oil and dispersant, or seawater only, were added 15 hours after the initial exposure. Sponges in each tank were photographed twice daily and monitored for visible signs of stress. After 40 hours, all samples were collected, preserved in TRIzol nucleic acid preservative (Invitrogen, Inc.) and frozen at -80◦C for molecular analyses.</p>
<h3>Microarray</h3>
<p>A custom stress-focused microarray with 1,695 scleractinian coral genes divided into 51 functional groups was used to assess gene expression profiles (Agilent Technologies). Gene functions range from normal cellular responses, such as metabolism, signaling and protein binding, to a suite of responsive genes related to biotransformation, apoptosis, DNA damage and repair, xenobiotics, drug metabolism, oxidative stress and antioxidant defense. Probes on the microarray consist of 60 base pair oligonucleotides that are representative of coral gene exon open reading frames (ORF) coding for a specific protein. The coral microarray can be used with sponge samples to test the similarity between these metazoan species.</p>
<h3>Sample processing for molecular analyses</h3>
<p>Total RNA was extracted from each sponge sample, reverse transcribed then copy RNA was synthesized and labeled with Cy3 dye following the manufacturer’s protocol (Agilent Technologies, Catalogue# 5190-2305). All Cy3-labeled cRNA samples were hybridized to individual microarrays using methods described in the manufacturer’s protocol (Agilent Technologies). Microarray chips were hybridized at 65ºC for 17 hrs then washed using solutions from Agilent. Chips were scanned and imaged at 535 nm using a high-resolution fluorescent GenePix® 4200A microarray scanner (Axon, Molecular Devices, California, USA).  </p>
<h3>RNA-Seq</h3>
<p>Total RNA samples from each colony were combined by treatment group to yield 10 µg at a concentration of &gt;200 ng/µL. The quality and quantity of the pooled samples were verified on a Nanodrop 1000 and Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100. RNA samples were shipped on dry ice to BaseClear (Netherlands) in November 2012 for library preparation and sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2000.</p>
<h3>Microarray Data analyses</h3>
<p>Raw intensity data were extracted from scanned images using GenePixPro 6.0 software (Molecular Devices) and imported into the R statistical computing environment. LIMMA (Linear Models for Microarray Data) was used for microarray analysis and data  quality was assessed using arrayQualityMetrics. </p>

<h4>BUSCO</h4>
<p>Benchmarking universal single-copy orthologs (BUSCO) is a metric for assessing the completeness of a transcriptome against databases of genes expected to be found in a group of species <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/31/19/3210/211866">Simão et al. 2015</a>.</p>
<p>This <em>A. crassa</em> transcriptome had an approximately 75% complete BUSCO scores compared to both the metazoan and eukaryota databases.</p>
